# Task ID: 15
# Title: Task #15: Enhanced Security Analysis Module Development
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Expand the existing security analysis module to implement comprehensive security checks as specified in section 5 of the PRD, including content security policies, injection vulnerabilities, authentication security, sensitive information detection, and third-party script analysis.
# Details:
This task involves extending the basic security module (Task #8) to provide more advanced security analysis capabilities:

1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Analysis:
   - Implement detection and validation of CSP headers
   - Identify missing directives and suggest improvements
   - Check for unsafe CSP configurations

2. Injection Vulnerability Detection:
   - Analyze for XSS vulnerabilities in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS
   - Check for SQL injection risks in form submissions
   - Identify potential CSRF vulnerabilities

3. Authentication and Session Security:
   - Verify secure cookie attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
   - Check for proper session management practices
   - Identify insecure authentication mechanisms

4. Sensitive Information Detection:
   - Scan for exposed API keys, tokens, and credentials
   - Identify unencrypted personal data
   - Check for sensitive data in localStorage/sessionStorage

5. Third-party Script Security Analysis:
   - Evaluate the security posture of external scripts
   - Check for outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities
   - Analyze third-party code loading practices

The module should generate detailed security recommendations with severity ratings and remediation steps. It must integrate with the existing security module from Task #8 while maintaining backward compatibility. The implementation should leverage the bookmarklet core structure from Task #1 to access and analyze page content.

Technical considerations:
- Use static code analysis techniques for vulnerability detection
- Implement pattern matching for sensitive data identification
- Create a modular architecture to allow for future security check additions
- Ensure minimal performance impact on the main application

# Test Strategy:
The enhanced security analysis module should be thoroughly tested using the following approach:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Create unit tests for each security check component
   - Verify correct detection of known security issues
   - Test edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Ensure proper integration with the core bookmarklet structure

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test integration with the existing security module (Task #8)
   - Verify that all security checks work together without conflicts
   - Ensure proper data flow between security analysis components

3. Vulnerability Test Suite:
   - Create a test suite with intentionally vulnerable web pages
   - Include examples of each vulnerability type to be detected
   - Verify that the module correctly identifies all vulnerabilities
   - Test against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure execution time on various page sizes and complexities
   - Ensure the enhanced module doesn't significantly impact page load times
   - Optimize any performance bottlenecks

5. Acceptance Testing:
   - Verify that all requirements from PRD section 5 are implemented
   - Ensure security recommendations are clear and actionable
   - Test on various browsers and platforms for compatibility
   - Validate that the security report format meets stakeholder requirements

6. Security Testing:
   - Perform a security review of the module itself
   - Ensure the module doesn't introduce new security risks
   - Verify secure handling of any sensitive data discovered

Success criteria:
- All test cases pass with at least 95% code coverage
- Module correctly identifies at least 90% of intentional vulnerabilities
- Performance impact is less than 500ms on standard test pages
- Security recommendations match industry best practices

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Content Security Policy Analysis Module [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module that analyzes Content Security Policy headers, identifies missing directives, and suggests improvements for better security posture.
### Details:
Develop a CSP analyzer that: 1) Extracts and parses CSP headers from HTTP responses, 2) Evaluates the completeness of CSP directives against best practices, 3) Identifies unsafe inline scripts/styles that violate CSP, 4) Generates recommendations for improving CSP configuration with specific directive suggestions, and 5) Assigns severity ratings to identified issues. Use the existing security module from Task #8 as a foundation and ensure the new module follows the same interface pattern.

## 2. Develop Injection Vulnerability Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Build a component that scans page content and scripts for potential XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF vulnerabilities.
### Details:
Implement pattern recognition algorithms to identify: 1) Unsanitized user inputs in DOM elements, 2) Potential XSS vectors in JavaScript event handlers and inline scripts, 3) Form submissions without CSRF tokens, 4) Unparameterized SQL-like query strings, and 5) DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities. Create a scoring system for vulnerability severity based on impact and exploitability. The detection system should analyze both static HTML and dynamically generated content through DOM traversal.

## 3. Create Authentication and Session Security Validator [done]
### Dependencies: 15.2
### Description: Develop functionality to analyze cookie attributes, session management practices, and authentication mechanisms for security weaknesses.
### Details:
Build a validator that: 1) Examines all cookies for secure attributes (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite), 2) Detects session identifiers transmitted insecurely, 3) Identifies weak authentication patterns like basic auth without TLS, 4) Checks for session timeout configurations, and 5) Analyzes password field implementations for security best practices. The validator should provide specific remediation steps for each identified issue, with code examples where applicable.

## 4. Implement Sensitive Information Detection Scanner [done]
### Dependencies: 15.3
### Description: Create a scanner that identifies exposed API keys, credentials, personal data, and other sensitive information in page source, scripts, and storage.
### Details:
Develop a scanner that: 1) Uses regex patterns to detect common API key formats, tokens, and credentials in source code, 2) Identifies potential PII in localStorage/sessionStorage, 3) Detects unencrypted transmission of sensitive data, 4) Recognizes common patterns for credit card numbers, SSNs, and other sensitive data, and 5) Checks for secure storage practices. Implement context-aware detection to reduce false positives. The scanner should categorize findings by sensitivity level and provide secure handling recommendations.

## 5. Build Third-party Script Security Analyzer [done]
### Dependencies: 15.4
### Description: Develop an analyzer that evaluates external scripts, checks for outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities, and assesses third-party code loading practices.
### Details:
Create an analyzer that: 1) Identifies all third-party scripts loaded by the page, 2) Extracts version information where available, 3) Compares against a vulnerability database to flag known vulnerable versions, 4) Evaluates script loading practices (e.g., integrity attributes, subresource integrity), 5) Assesses the security implications of script permissions and access patterns. The analyzer should generate a risk report for each third-party component with specific upgrade recommendations and security enhancement suggestions.
