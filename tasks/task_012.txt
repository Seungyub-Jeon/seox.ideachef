# Task ID: 12
# Title: Task #12: Internationalization and Localization Module Development
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a comprehensive internationalization and localization module that analyzes language settings, validates character encoding, detects localized content, and evaluates multi-language support on web pages.
# Details:
This task involves creating a module that integrates with the bookmarklet core structure (Task #1) to analyze internationalization and localization aspects of web pages. The implementation should include:

1. Language Detection:
   - Parse HTML lang attributes from the document and its elements
   - Detect language switching mechanisms and language selection options
   - Identify content in multiple languages within the same page

2. Character Encoding Analysis:
   - Validate proper character encoding declarations (meta charset, Content-Type headers)
   - Check for encoding inconsistencies or potential display issues
   - Identify potential character rendering problems

3. Localization Feature Detection:
   - Analyze date/time formats used throughout the page
   - Identify number formatting patterns (decimal separators, thousand separators)
   - Detect currency formats and symbols
   - Recognize region-specific content adaptations

4. Multi-language Support Evaluation:
   - Check for language-specific URLs or subdomains
   - Identify content translation mechanisms
   - Evaluate RTL (Right-to-Left) language support

5. Reporting:
   - Generate a comprehensive report on internationalization readiness
   - Provide recommendations for improving global accessibility
   - Highlight potential localization issues or inconsistencies

The module should be designed with extensibility in mind, allowing for future additions of region-specific checks. It should align with section 8 of the PRD regarding internationalization and localization features.

# Test Strategy:
Testing for the internationalization and localization module should include:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create tests for each detection function (language detection, encoding validation, etc.)
   - Test with various HTML inputs containing different language attributes and encodings
   - Verify correct identification of date/time formats, number formats, and currency symbols

2. Integration Tests:
   - Test integration with the bookmarklet core structure (Task #1)
   - Verify proper data collection and analysis pipeline
   - Ensure the module correctly accesses and processes the page HTML

3. Multilingual Test Cases:
   - Create test pages with content in multiple languages
   - Test with pages that use different character sets (Latin, Cyrillic, CJK, etc.)
   - Verify detection of RTL languages and proper analysis

4. Edge Cases:
   - Test with pages that have mixed language content
   - Test with incorrectly encoded pages to verify error handling
   - Test with region-specific formatting variations

5. Manual Verification:
   - Test on real-world multilingual websites
   - Verify results against known internationalization patterns
   - Compare detection results with browser's language and encoding settings

6. Performance Testing:
   - Measure execution time on complex multilingual pages
   - Ensure the module doesn't significantly impact overall bookmarklet performance

7. Acceptance Criteria:
   - Module correctly identifies at least 95% of language settings
   - All major character encodings are properly detected
   - Date/time, number, and currency formats are accurately identified
   - Report generation is complete and provides actionable insights

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Language Detection and Analysis [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a module component that detects and analyzes language settings and multilingual content on web pages.
### Details:
Implement functions to: 1) Extract and parse HTML lang attributes from document and elements using DOM traversal, 2) Detect language switching mechanisms by identifying language selection UI elements, 3) Create an algorithm to identify content in multiple languages by analyzing text patterns and language-specific characters, 4) Generate a structured data object containing all language-related findings. Use the Language Detection API or language detection libraries if appropriate.

## 2. Develop Character Encoding Analysis Component [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build a component that validates character encoding declarations and identifies potential encoding issues.
### Details:
Implement functions to: 1) Extract and validate meta charset tags and Content-Type headers, 2) Check for encoding inconsistencies by comparing declared encoding with actual content encoding, 3) Identify potential character rendering problems by scanning for problematic character sequences or encoding mismatches, 4) Create detection algorithms for common encoding issues like mojibake or garbled text. Use TextDecoder API for encoding validation where appropriate.

## 3. Create Localization Feature Detection System [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system to analyze and detect localization features including date/time formats, number formatting, and region-specific content.
### Details:
Implement functions to: 1) Analyze date/time formats by identifying date patterns in text content, 2) Detect number formatting patterns including decimal and thousand separators, 3) Recognize currency formats and symbols through regex pattern matching, 4) Identify region-specific content adaptations by analyzing content variations. Create a comprehensive pattern library for different regional formats to support detection algorithms.

## 4. Build Multi-language Support Evaluation Module [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a module to evaluate a website's multi-language infrastructure and RTL language support.
### Details:
Implement functions to: 1) Analyze URL patterns to detect language-specific URLs or subdomains, 2) Identify content translation mechanisms like translation APIs or content switching, 3) Evaluate RTL language support by checking for dir attributes, CSS properties like text-align:right, and RTL-specific layouts, 4) Create algorithms to detect hreflang tags and language-specific metadata. Implement heuristics to determine if a site uses content negotiation for language selection.

## 5. Develop Comprehensive Reporting and Integration System [done]
### Dependencies: 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.4
### Description: Create a reporting system that integrates all internationalization findings and provides actionable recommendations.
### Details:
Implement functions to: 1) Aggregate data from all previous modules into a unified data structure, 2) Generate a comprehensive report on internationalization readiness with severity levels for issues, 3) Provide specific recommendations for improving global accessibility based on detected issues, 4) Highlight potential localization inconsistencies with examples, 5) Integrate with the bookmarklet core structure from Task #1 to display results in the UI. Include extensibility points for adding future region-specific checks.
